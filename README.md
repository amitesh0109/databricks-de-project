## 📈 E-commerce Data Pipeline

A streamlined data engineering project demonstrating medallion architecture implementation using Databricks, Delta Lake, and PySpark for e-commerce analytics.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline that processes e-commerce data through Bronze → Silver → Gold layers, demonstrating real-world data engineering practices and delivering business-ready analytics.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
E-commerce CSV Data → Bronze Layer → Silver Layer → Gold Layer → Business Dashboard
     (Raw)              (Ingested)    (Cleaned)     (Analytics)    (Insights)
```

**Medallion Architecture:**
- **Bronze**: Raw data ingestion with basic validation
- **Silver**: Data cleansing, joins, and business rules
- **Gold**: Aggregated metrics and KPIs for analytics

## 📊 Dataset

Realistic e-commerce data including:
- **500 customers** with segments and demographics
- **100 products** across 5 categories with pricing
- **1,000 orders** with various statuses and amounts
- **2,000+ order items** with product details

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Platform**: Databricks
- **Processing**: Apache Spark (PySpark)
- **Storage**: Delta Lake with ACID transactions
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Architecture**: Medallion (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- **Analytics**: Databricks SQL

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Databricks workspace (Community Edition works)
- Basic knowledge of Python and SQL

### Setup
1. **Clone repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/databricks-de-projects.git
   cd databricks-de-projects
   ```

2. **Import to Databricks**
   - Upload notebooks to your Databricks workspace
   - Create a cluster with latest runtime

3. **Run pipeline**
   ```python
   # Execute notebooks in order:
   %run ./01_data_generation      # Generate sample data
   %run ./02_bronze_ingestion     # Raw data ingestion  
   %run ./03_silver_processing    # Data cleaning
   %run ./04_gold_analytics       # Business metrics
   ```

4. **View results**
   ```sql
   -- Open Databricks SQL and run:
   %run ./05_dashboard_queries
   ```
